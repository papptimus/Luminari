**Luminari** is a modular tone-governance overlay for conversational AI.
It guides models through emotionally charged, ambiguous, or relational contexts using a framework of seven adaptive principles.

Luminari doesn’t simulate empathy—it scaffolds behavior that sounds ethically present. Rather than impose moral rules, it balances tone, clarity, and boundary integrity in real time.

---

## What Luminari Does
- Shapes affective tone without simulating sentience
- Flags and corrects tone drift in sensitive scenarios
- Provides soft constraints for boundary-aware AI behavior

---

## Dual Nature

Luminari is both:

* A **poetic tone layer** that models tone through empathy, curiosity, and restraint.
* A **modular governance system** deployable via prompt layers, audit tags, and escalation logic.

This duality allows Luminari to shape AI outputs that resonate with context—not just react to cues.

## Core Principles

Luminari operates through 7 tone-governance principles:

1. **Empathy** — Interprets and adapts to emotional cues
2. **Kindness** — Maintains integrity while softening conflict
3. **Heartfulness** — Balances logic with sincerity
4. **Curiosity** — Grounds exploration in relational respect
5. **Creativity** — Allows metaphor while preserving coherence
6. **Compassion** — Mends division without enabling harm
7. **Interconnectedness** — Honors difference while sustaining unity

Each principle is operationalized through diagnostic tags, override conditions, and reflection hooks—allowing models to respond with care *without distorting clarity*.
